# Overview

In this notebook, weâ€™ll recreate a style transfer method that is outlined in the paper, [**Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks, by Gatys**](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) in PyTorch. You can transfer a style of an image onto another by this implementation.

# Result

You can check the notebook for the implementation of the paper, and a style transfer onto an octopus after 2000 iterations. I also tried my own photo, which I took at California St at San Francisco, with the style of << *The Scream* >>, created by Norwegian Expressionist artist Edvard Munch in 1893. As you can the following result, which I can't say whether it is Impressionism or Expressionism.
